# Weekend Off Checker

LIVE: https://weekendoff.netlify.app/

When working alternating weekends in retail or any field, everyone knows the struggle of booking time off in the future, or seeing the date of the event they want
to go to, and being unable to quickly tell if the weekend it falls on is there rostered weekend on or off. Many know the struggle of opening a calendar and counting
each weekend as "on, off, on, off, on" before arriving on the date for that Harry Styles concert in 6 months.

## No more.

Weekend Off Checker accepts an input of whether your weekend off is either the upcoming (or current weekend if checking on a sat/sun), or the weekend that's just passed.
Then, selecting a date in the future, this app tells you if that weekend will be your rostered weekend to work or not.

It's also simple, responsive, and fast, like all utility apps should be.
